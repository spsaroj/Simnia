# Building your Shell, part 3 

## 44-550 Operating Systems


This is the class project I did in Operating Systems.
This project had me practice the following skills/C functions:

* Process creation (`fork()`)
* Process execution (`exec*`)
* Function pointers

###How to run?
```bash
make simnia
./simnia
```
You can then run basic commands! Things like `ls`, `git`, and other `pwd` should all work as intended.
